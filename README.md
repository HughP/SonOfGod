# Are the concepts compatible?
A repo of ideas about church relations and Bible translation


In working with the text of the newer (2000) Navajo translation, I read some of the reasons for updating the translaiton is were divine terms. That is, the Navajo word for God was argued to be insufient to represent the God presented in the Bible. It is interesting to trace where this idea comes from. I wonder if this is a theological idea which comes from conservitive evangelical american theologians, or if this idea comes from translation interpretation testing, or if this idea comes from Navajo language users.
More generally this same issue of terms seems to appear in the american christian press when discussing the issue of weither Bible translations should contain the term Allah for referencing the God in the Christian scriptures. 

There seems to be an interesting paper which I should read called: [_Christian Concepts and Navaho words_](https://www.google.com/search?q=Christian+concepts+and+Navaho+words&oq=Christian+concepts+and+Navaho+words&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.503j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=Christian+concepts+and+Navajo+words&spell=1). I have seen it cited as: "Christian Concepts and Navaho Words," Utah Humanities Review 13, no
Liebler, H. Baxter (1948), Unpublished 'Christian concepts and Navaho words', Utah Humanitites Review 2(2): 169-174.


In more broadly we can even a wide range of discussion about terms for concepts. How those concepts map to concepts in the Bible, or how various Chrisitan groups understand those concepts in the Bible is an interesting mapping. For instance here is a discussion about the Navajo word for "Hell" http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Talk:ch%CA%BC%C4%AF%CC%81%C4%AFdiitah
